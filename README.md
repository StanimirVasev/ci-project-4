Therefore the website aims to provide smooth buying experience with as few barriers as possible from product view to taking payment. 


The site functionality will allow users to search and view all of the products on the site in detail, proceed straight to  checkout where they can to complete the order if they so wish. The site also offers features that are only available to registered users such as the profile page which displays the order history information.

#### **1.3 - Design Choices** ####
<br>

**FONTS**

* For the website i decided to use the google font style of Lato as it is a clean, modern, and highly legible typeface that enhances the overall readability and aesthetic of the site. Its versatility makes it suitable for various types of content and ensures a consistent and professional look throughout the website.


**ICONS**

* I have integrated icons throughout the website to enhance user experience by making it more intuitive and engaging. All the icons used are sourced from Font Awesome, ensuring a high-quality and consistent design across the site.

**COLOURS**

* In the design of the CamShop website, I've used a palette that emphasises clarity and style. The primary colours include:

* Black (#000): Utilised for buttons, text, and borders, providing a strong contrast and modern aesthetic.
* Orange (#FFA500): Used for overlay, highlights, button hover effects, and background colours to create vibrant accents and draw attention.
* White (#FFFFFF): Applied as the background colour for various elements to ensure readability and a clean appearance.
* Grey (#555): A softer text colour for general content to reduce strain and enhance readability.

* Additional styling includes various shades of grey for borders and shadows to create depth and separation between elements. These colours work together to create a cohesive and visually appealing experience across the site.


**IMAGES**

* Most of the images used on the CamShop website were sourced from Canva Pro, ensuring a professional and consistent visual style. For camera product images, I have sourced high-quality visuals from [Photosynthesis](https://magazin.photosynthesis.bg/).

#### **1.4 - Wireframes ** ####

#### **1.5 - Database Design** ####

* Each card includes an image representing the post, which links to the detailed view of the post. If a post does not have an associated image, a default image is shown. 

* Below the image, the title of the post is displayed, and further details, including the category and edit/delete links (for superusers), are provided.

* If no posts are available within the selected category, a message is shown indicating the absence of posts. 

* Additionally, the page includes pagination controls to navigate through multiple pages of posts if there are more posts than can fit on a single page. A button for returning to the top of the page is also available to enhance navigation.

<hr>

#### **2.13 - Add Blog Page** ####

* Similar like the Add Product page, the add blog page allows users to create and submit a new blog post. At the top, there is a section for the page header that includes a heading and a subtitle indicating the purpose of the page.

The main content area contains a form for adding a new blog post. This form includes fields for entering blog details such as the title, content, and category. Users can also upload an image to accompany the blog post. Each form field is rendered using Django's crispy forms for consistent styling. There is an option to cancel the form submission and return to the blog list or submit the form to add the new blog post.

* The page includes a script that updates the displayed file name when a new image is selected, helping users confirm the image they are uploading.

<hr>

#### **1.14 - Edit Blog Page** ####

* Similar to the Edit Product page, the edit blog page is designed for users to modify an existing blog post. It starts with a page header that includes a title and subtitle, indicating the page's purpose.

* In the content area, the user is presented with a form pre-filled with the current details of the blog post. The form allows users to update various fields such as the title, content, and category, as well as upload a new image if desired. Each field is rendered individually, and there is a label associated with each input for clarity.

* At the bottom of the form, users have the option to either cancel their changes and return to the blog post details page or submit the form to update the blog post. There is also a JavaScript function that updates the displayed file name when a new image is selected, providing feedback on the file being uploaded.

<hr>

#### **2.15 - Toasts** ####

* Toast notifications serve to provide users with feedback on their actions or system statuses in a non-intrusive manner. They briefly display important messages or updates and are designed to be visually distinctive based on the context, such as success, warning, error, or informational messages.

* A success toast indicates a successful action or operation, showing a "Success!" message with a green highlight and a white background. The body of the toast details the successful outcome and includes additional information such as a summary of recently added items in a shopping bag, their total cost, and options for proceeding to checkout. It features a call-to-action button to guide users to secure checkout if relevant.

* A warning toast alerts users to potential issues or actions needing attention. It displays a "Warning!" message. The content warns users about what they need to be cautious of or what action they should take.

* An error toast notifies users of problems or failed actions, with an "Error!" message highlighted in red. This toast clearly conveys that something has gone wrong. The body provides details about the error, helping users understand what went wrong and suggesting possible resolutions.

* An info toast provides general updates or information. It displays an "Info" message. The content gives users updates or changes that are not urgent but still important, using a different background to differentiate it from success, warning, and error messages.

* All toasts include a close button allowing users to dismiss the notification manually. They also feature custom styling to ensure visual consistency and includes additional content based on user actions, such as details of a shopping bag or specific error messages.

<hr>

#### **2.16 - Sign up and real email notifications via gmail ** ####

* To become a registered user, individuals can complete the sign-up process quickly and easily. Start by clicking the 'My Account' icon in the top right corner of the page on desktop or in the top row on mobile. From the dropdown menu, select 'Register.'

* On the sign-up page, users will be required to provide their email address, create a unique username, and set a password of their choice. The form includes validation checks to ensure all required fields are filled in. If any fields are missing, a pop-up will appear indicating which fields need to be completed.

* If a user attempts to register with an email address or username that is already in use, they will receive a notification when trying to submit the form, informing them that the email or username is already taken.

* Once the form is completed with valid details, users will be notified that an email has been sent to the address they provided. They must then verify their email by clicking the link included in the email. After clicking the link, the user will be directed to a confirmation page on the site, where they need to click the 'Confirm Email Address' button. Following confirmation, the user will be redirected to the login page.

<hr>

#### **2.17 - Login page ** ####

* The login page is designed to be straightforward. Users need to enter their username or email address and their password to access their account. Both fields are required, and the form will not submit unless the details are entered correctly.

* Additional features on the login page include the "Remember Me" option, which allows users to stay logged in without needing to re-enter their details in future sessions. There is also a "Forgot Password" link for users who need to recover their password. By clicking this link, users are prompted to enter their email address, and reset instructions will be sent to them. If a user lands on the login page without an account, a notice will direct them to register.

* Upon clicking the "Forgot Password" link, users will receive an email with instructions on how to reset their password. Following the link in the email will direct them to a page where they can enter a new password.

<hr>

#### **2.18 - Stripe Integration ** ####

* This project integrates Stripe to handle payment processing, fulfilling a key requirement of the MS4 project. Once users have completed their shopping and added items to their cart, they proceed to the checkout page. At this stage, a payment intent is created in the Stripe dashboard, which is visible in the Stripe events section.

* Upon submitting their details in the checkout form and passing validation checks, users click the "Pay Now" button If the payment is successfully processed, users are directed to an order confirmation page that provides a detailed breakdown of their order.

* In the Stripe dashboard, key events related to the payment are tracked. Each event captures crucial data, including the amount charged, billing address, and contact details. Additionally, metadata includes the shopping bag item IDs, quantities, and whether the user has opted to save their delivery address information. For anonymous users (those who are not registered or logged in), this information is also reflected in the metadata.

* The shipping address is another vital piece of information captured by Stripe. Currently, the project uses the same address for both shipping and billing.

* Webhooks are used in this project to manage scenarios where users may close their browser either intentionally or unintentionally after placing an order and pressing the "Pay Now" button. In such cases, webhooks ensure that the order is still recorded in Django and all payment details are sent to Stripe. This mechanism helps prevent situations where a user is billed but does not receive their items, ensuring a smooth and reliable transaction process.

<hr>

#### **2.19 - Footer** ####

* The footer provides essential information and navigation for users. 

* It includes an "About Us" section that describes the company and its mission to deliver high-quality cameras and accessories. 

* The "Contact Us" section lists the companyâ€™s address, phone number, and email address. 

* The "Follow Us" section features social media icons linking to the companyâ€™s profiles on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. 

* At the bottom, there is a copyright notice for the current year, indicating that all rights are reserved. The design features a dark background with white text for clarity and contrast.

<hr>

#### **2.20 - Future Developments** ####

* Analytics and Monitoring: To better understand user behaviour and improve site performance, future updates will include the integration of advanced tracking and analytics tools. These tools will monitor user interactions, page performance, and site errors, providing valuable data that can be used to make informed, data-driven improvements to the site.

* User Feedback Mechanism: A user feedback mechanism will be introduced to allow users to provide feedback or report issues directly through the site. By offering options for users to share their experiences and concerns, we will gather valuable insights, enabling prompt responses to user needs and continuous enhancement of the user experience.

* Documentation and Support: Comprehensive documentation will be developed to support both users and administrators. This will include FAQs, troubleshooting guides, and detailed contact information for technical support. These resources will ensure users have access to the necessary information to navigate and resolve any issues they encounter, while also providing clear guidance for administrators managing the site.

* Company Pages: Additional company pages will be created to enhance transparency and engagement. These will include an "About Us" page to provide information about the company, a "Our Culture" page to showcase the company's values and work environment, and a "Careers" page to outline job opportunities and career development within the company. These pages will help build a stronger connection with users and potential employees by highlighting the company's mission, culture, and career prospects.

</strong></summary>
<br>

#### **1.1 HTML Code Validating** ####

* All of the HTML files were tested on the [W3C HTML Markup Validation website](https://validator.w3.org/)<br>
* The results from the test were as follows:<br>

**Warning that appears on all pages** 

* The HTML checker reports an error due to a duplicate id of "user-options". However, this issue is not a problem and can be disregarded. The id "user-options" appears in both the base.html file, which is used for the desktop version, and the mobile-top-header.html file, which is used for the mobile version. Despite having the same id, these elements serve the same function but are specific to different device views. This duplication does not impact the site's functionality. I have included this note in the README to acknowledge awareness of the issue.<br>

**1 Homepage (home/templates/home/index.html)**

* Apart from the duplicate-id error at the top of this section, all the HTML passes with no errors.

* Initially, I had this warning but I have fixed it: 

* Warning: The type attribute is unnecessary for JavaScript resources. <script type="text/javascript">

**2. Products page (products/templates/products/products.html)**

* Apart from the warning duplicate-id error and JS warning, the rest of the HTML has no errors. JS warning was fixed.

**3. Product details (products/templates/products/product_details.html)**

* Apart from the warning duplicate-id error and JS warning, I had 3 Errors: Unclosed element div. and 1 Fatal Error for unclosed form. I fixed those issues and now the html template has no other issues left.

**4. Bag/Cart (bag/templates/bag.html)**

* Apart from the warning duplicate-id error and JS warning, the rest of the HTML has no errors. JS warning was fixed.

**5. Checkout (checkout/templates/checkout.html)**

* Apart from the warning duplicate-id error, JS warning, and 1 warning for empty h1 for my spinner. the rest of the HTML has no errors. JS warning was fixed and I replaced the h1 with div instead and added text to fix the issue.

**6. Checkout Success (checkout/templates/checkout_success.html)**

* Apart from the warning duplicate-id error and JS warning, the rest of the HTML has no errors. JS warning was fixed.

**7. Blog (blog/templates/blog.html)**

* Apart from the warning duplicate-id error, JS warning, and 1 extra unnecessary div, the rest of the HTML has no errors. JS and div warning were fixed.

**8. Blog Detail (blog/templates/blog_detail.html)**

* Apart from the warning duplicate-id error and JS warning, the rest of the HTML has no errors. JS warning was fixed.

**9. Blog Category (blog/templates/blog_category.html)**

* Apart from the warning duplicate-id error and JS warning, the rest of the HTML has no errors. JS warning was fixed.

**10. Add Product (products/templates/add_product.html)**

* Apart from the warning duplicate-id error and JS warning, the rest of the HTML has no errors. JS warning was fixed. 

* There was another Error: Element p not allowed as child of element strong in this context. but as this was coming from custom_widget_templates/custom_clearable_file_input.html come that I copy/pasted, I didn't want to break the code. I would have replaced the paragraph with a div.

**11. Add Blog (blog/templates/add_blog.html)**

* Apart from the warning duplicate-id error and JS warning, the rest of the HTML has no errors. JS warning was fixed. 

**12. Edit Product (products/templates/edit_product.html)**

* Apart from the warning duplicate-id error and JS warning, there were 4 more errors. 

* Error: An img element must have an alt attribute, except under certain conditions. As this error is related to the images that are added from AWS, I am unsure how to add alt text. 

* Info: Trailing slash on void elements has no effect and interacts badly with unquoted attribute values. - I removed  the trailing slash from br.

* The other 2 errors were coming from custom_widget_templates/custom_clearable_file_input.html come that I copy/pasted, I didn't want to break the code. I would have replaced the paragraph with a div.

* JS warning was fixed. 

**12. Edit Blog (blog/templates/edit_blog.html)**

* Apart from the warning duplicate-id error and JS warning, the rest of the HTML has no errors. JS warning was fixed.

<hr>

#### **1.3 JavaScript Code Validating** ####

* The testing for the script.js file was carried out on [JShint.com](https://jshint.com/) The results from the test were as follows:<br>

**1. bag/templates/bag/bag.html**

* Tested the JS in bag template which gave me 7 warnings, I fixed 1 missing semicolon but the rest of the code. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to fix the rest of the warnings as Jshint was showing them on the first script element.

* For reference, the six warnings are listed below:
Expected an identifier and instead saw '<'.
Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression.
Missing semicolon.
Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression.
Unclosed regular expression.
Unrecoverable syntax error. (100% scanned).

**2. products/templates/products.html**

* Tested the JS in products template which gave me 6 warnings, I fixed 1 missing semicolon but the rest of the code. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to fix the rest of the warnings as Jshint was showing them on the first script element.

Five warnings
1	Expected an identifier and instead saw '<'.
1	Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression.
1	Missing semicolon.
5	Unclosed regular expression.
5	Unrecoverable syntax error. (17% scanned).

**3. products/templates/products/includes/quantity_input_script.html**

* Tested the JS in quantity_input_script which gave me 8 warnings, I fixed 2 missing semicolon but the rest of the code. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to fix the rest of the warnings as Jshint was showing them on the first script element.

**4. templates/base.html**

* Tested the JS in base.html which gave me 6 warnings, Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to fix the warnings as Jshint was showing them on the script element.

Six warnings
1	Expected an identifier and instead saw '<'.
1	Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression.
1	Missing semicolon.
2	Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression.
3	Unclosed regular expression.
3	Unrecoverable syntax error. (100% scanned).

**5. stripe_elements.js file**
* Tested the JS in stripe_elements.js which gave me multiple warnings about undefined variables 

* However, as this code is taken from the Stripe official documentation it appears to be correct so i have noted this here. 

**6. country_field.js file**

* Tested the JS in country_field.js which gave me multiple warnings about undefined variables. Unfortunately, it wasn't something I could fix and it seems like the code is working correctly.

<hr>

#### **1.4 Python Code Validating** ####

* The testing for the python files were carried out on [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) The results from the test were as follows:<br>

* Webhooks_handler.py has 4 warnings, however, i left the code here as it has to do with Stripe's official documentation.

93: E501 line too long (80 > 79 characters)
94: E501 line too long (80 > 79 characters)
125: E501 line too long (103 > 79 characters)
164: E501 line too long (89 > 79 characters)

* Webhook.py had 1 warning, however, i left the code here as it has to do with Stripe's official documentation.

43: E501 line too long (86 > 79 characters)

* All of the other python code has passed the pep8 checks. I have used flake8 and fixed a wide range of issues. There are however some lines of code that showed up as needing tweaking. Some of these items from Flake8 i have ignored, the reason for each of these can be found below:

* ./reviews/views.py:36:13: F841 local variable 'e' is assigned to but never used - Reason: When I remove the variable 'e', flake8 is satisfied but pep8 CI linter gives me an error saying that I shouldn't use bare except.

* Certain lines in the settings.py file exceed 79 characters, as indicated. However, these lines were generated automatically when the project was created and reflect Django's default settings. As these settings were not manually written by me, I will be disregarding these particular warnings and will not modify them, as they were automatically configured.

* For the Files: /.vscode/arctictern.py, ./blog/migrations/0001_initial.py, ./checkout/migrations/0001_initial.py, ./products/migrations/0001_initial.py, ./profiles/migrations/0001_initial.py, ./reviews/migrations/0001_initial.py:

* Some lines in these files exceed 79 characters. These files include automatically generated code, especially migration files created by Django and configuration files. As these files are auto-generated and not manually written by me, I will not be adjusting them or addressing these specific warnings.

#### **2.1 Manual testing mobile** ####
<br>

* To reduce repetition of the desktop results, for the mobile testing i have just highlighted the different functionalities that mobile users may experience while using the site on a mobile device. I have carried out all of the exact same manual tests on mobile devices as i did on the desktop.

Mobile testing was carried out on the following devices:<br>
1. iPhone SE/12 Pro (Via Chrome Dev Tools)
2. iPad Air (Via Chrome Dev Tools)

**1. iPhone 12 Pro**

* On shopping bag/cart page, the quantity selector works but covers the number of units you have. All links work correctly but this could be improved.
* On blog detail page, the header appears quite big sometimes depending on how long the copy is. Font size could be reduced based on certain situations where copy is too long. Also, there is quite a bit whitespace at the bottom between reviews and footer. This could be improved.
* Everything else works as expected.

**2. iPhone SE**

* Icons in the navigation aren't properly aligned with hamburger icon. This could be improved.
* On shopping bag/cart page, the quantity selector works but covers the number of units you have. All links work correctly but this could be improved.

**3. iPad Air**

* Font is quite small on blog body and product description. This could be enlarged to improve user readability and experience.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>
3. Responsiveness
</strong></summary>
<br>

**3.1 Chrome Dev Tools**
* I have tested the siteâ€™s responsiveness using Google DevTools, covering screen sizes from a maximum of 1870px x 767px down to a minimum of 320px x 480px. The site performs as expected across all tested dimensions.

</details>
<hr>

#### **3.2 Development Issues** ####
<br>

* SECRET_KEY Issue

* When I began building the project, I started making commits to GitHub but realised that I had exposed my secret_key value to github. I have removed this key and created a new one with django secret_key generator I found on Google. I then stored all my variables in Gitpod and Heroku. I then replaced the secret key with this code in settings.py: `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')`. The new SECRET_KEY is secured and no longer exposed and the old one has been discarded. 
<hr>

**2. Stripe Webhooks**

*In my Stripe webhooks, I was constantly encountering 4 out of 4 errors but I found the Stripe debugging PDF in Slack and watched the lecturer's video and I managed to get 3 out of 4. I struggled for a bit to realise how to get 4 out of 4 and I spoke with my mentor to test this functionality together. After inspecting the flow, he reassured me that everything is working correctly as we are getting the order pid in Django admin and the payment in Stripe.

**3. Mobile Navbar Icons**

* During mobile testing, I discovered that on smaller screen sizes, the navbar icons were being pushed down onto a separate line. This occurred on mobile devices with smaller screens.

* The issue was caused by the text, icons, and padding being too large for the smaller screen sizes.


**4. Shopping cart/bag quantity selector**

* During mobile testing, I discovered that the quantity selector works fine but doesn't display well and hides the unit box on smaller screens. Media query has to be updated for smaller screens.

5. Deployment
</strong></summary>
<br>

#### **Deployment to Heroku and Cloning Instructions** ####

* Below are the following steps i undertook to deploy the site to Heroku. If you are looking to clone this project and work on it you can follow the step by step guide below as it details every step i took to deploy to Heroku. Cloning from the repository instructions are found below the Heroku and AWS instructions below. 

1. Navigate to the Heroku website [Here]( https://www.heroku.com/)

2. Give your app a name and select the region closest to you. Once completed, click the "Create App" button.

3. Click on the "Resources" tab and type "Postgres" in the add-ons search bar. Select "Heroku Postgres" from the results. A pop-up will open; choose the "Hobby Dev - Free" plan and click "Provision."

4. Navigate back to Gitpod and install the following packages:<br>
`pip3 install dj_database_url`  
`pip3 install psycopg2-binary`

5. Freeze your requirements.txt file with:<br> 
`pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`

6. In settings.py, add: `import dj_database_url`

7. Update the DATABASES section in settings.py. Comment out the default configuration and insert:<br>
`DATABASES = {`<br>
`'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))`<br>
`}`

You can find your DATABASE_URL in your Heroku Config Vars. Warning: DATABASE_URL is an environmental variable and should not be shown in version control, so ensure you don't push this to GitHub.</strong></em>

8. You need to make all migrations but first, view the migrations with:`python3 manage.py showmigartions`

9. Then run: `python3 manage.py migrate`

10. After migration, upload all the products for the store again with:<br>
`python3 manage.py loaddata categories`<br>
`python3 manage.py loaddata subcategories`
`python3 manage.py loaddata products`

It is crucial to load categories first, as all products fall into a category. In my project, I used 3 fixtures files stored in my products app.

11. Create a superuser to log in with: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`

12. Save, commit, and push your project to GitHub. Uncomment the original DATABASES configuration, ensuring the DATABASE_URL is not pushed to the public domain.

13. Use an if-else statement in settings.py to switch between Postgres and the default database based on the availability of the DATABASE_URL variable.<br>

14. Install Gunicorn to act as the web server:`pip3 install Gunicorn` and then freeze again (`pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`).

15. Create a Procfile in the root directory to instruct Heroku on how to run the app. Write this code inside: `web: gunicorn <Project Name>.wsgi:application`

16. Log in to Heroku via the terminal. You can log in with your username and password.

17. Temporarily disable the collection of static files until AWS setup is complete:<br>
`heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app Heroku Project Name`

18. In settings.py, add the allowed hosts for both local and Heroku:<br>
`ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["<heroku appname>.herokuapp.com", "localhost"]` 

19. Save, commit, and push your changes to GitHub. Then push to Heroku to start building the app:
`heroku git:remote -a <heroku appname>`
`git push heroku master`

* Heroku should now start building the app, and your Heroku URL should be visible in the terminal. Note: At this point, your project won't have any static files, so don't worry if the site looks different from development. This will be resolved in the next section on AWS (Amazon Web Services).

20. o save time, set up automatic deployment when you push to GitHub. Go back to your Heroku dashboard and click on the "Deploy" tab. Here you will see "GitHub Connect to GitHub."

Search for your repository name. Once you see the repository, click on the connect button next to it.

21. Scroll down and enable automatic deploys. Click "Enable Automatic Deploys." Now, every time you push to GitHub, your app should update on Heroku.

#### **Amazon Web Services - AWS and Cloning Instructions** ####

* For this project, I used Amazon Web Services (AWS) to store static files and images. Below are the steps I followed to set this up. If you are looking to clone this project and work on it, you can follow this guide.

1. Open up [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) in your browser
2. Click on "Create AWS Account."
3. Complete all required questions during the sign-up process.
4. Once registration is complete, navigate to your AWS dashboard.
5. Use Amazon S3 services. To find it quickly, type "S3" into the search bar.
6. Select S3, then click on "Create Bucket." Name your bucket something relevant to the project. Select the region closest to you from the dropdown menu.
7. Uncheck the box that says "Block all public access." AWS may warn you, but you can ignore this since the static files need to be public. Click the "Create bucket" button.
8. Set the settings in the bucket:

> Go to bucket properties.<br>
> Turn on static web hosting.<br>
> in the index and error text inputs, add index.html and error.html and then save.<br>

9. On the permissions tab, fill out the CORS configuration section.

10. Go to the bucket policy tab and select policy generator. Set it up as follows:<br>
> Type of Policy: S3 bucket policy<br>
> In Principal enter * to select all principals<br>
> From the action dropdown, select "GetObject"<br>
> For your ARN, copy and paste it from the bucket policy page<br>
> Click "Add Statement"<br>
> Click "Generate Policy"<br>
> Copy and paste the generated policy into your bucket policy<br>
> BAdd /* to the end of the resources key<br>
> Click save.<br>

11. Go to Access Control List and set "List objects" permission to everyone (public).

12. Create a new group and user to access the bucket. In the search box, type "IAM" (Identity Access Management):
> Click "Create a new group" and name it something like manage-<project name>.
> Click through the pages and create the group.<br>

13. Create a group policy:
> Click on "Policies" in the menu and then "Create policy."
> Select the JSON tab and import managed policies.
> Search for "AmazonS3FullAccess" and import it.
> In the resources section, paste in the ARN used previously. Enter the ARN twice, adding /* at the end of the second one.
> Click through to review policy, give it a name and description, and generate the policy.

14. Click on "Groups" from the side menu, select the group you created, click "Attach policy," search for the policy you created, and attach it.

15. Create a user:
> Click "Users" from the menu, then "Add user."
> Create a username, select programmatic access, and click next.
> Select the group to add your user to, click through to the end, and create the user.
> Download the CSV file containing the user keys needed to access the app.

Warning: Do not share the keys from this CSV file with anyone or make them public by pushing them to your GitHub.

#### **Connect bucket to Django and Cloning Instructions** ####

* To connect Django to the AWS S3 bucket, follow these steps:

1. Install necessary packages:
`pip3 install boto3`
`pip3 install django-storages`

2. This ensures the new packages are added to requirements.txt and deployed to Heroku.
`pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`

3. Update settings.py - Add storages to the INSTALLED_APPS section in settings.py.

4. Create an environment variable called USE_AWS to run the code on Heroku. Include the following settings in settings.py:

5. Go to the Heroku settings tab and click "Reveal Config Vars." Set up the necessary environment variables, ensuring USE_AWS is set to True.

6. Delete the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC variable from Heroku.

7. In Gitpod, create a custom_storages.py file to instruct Django to use Amazon S3 for storing static and media files. Add the following classes:

> `class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):`<br>
> `location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION`<br>

> `class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):`<br>
> `location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION`<br>

8. Save, commit, and push changes<br><br>

#### **Add Media files to AWS and Cloning Instructions** ####

* To upload images to S3, follow these steps:

1. In your AWS bucket, create a new folder called media.

2. Select the media folder and upload all your image folders and files. Ensure permissions are set to Everyone (Public access). 

3. Update your HTML code to reflect the new media storage location. Change image src attributes from:
src="media/..." to src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}<insert image name and file type>".

#### **Stripe and Cloning Instructions** ####

* The final step is to add the Stripe keys to the config variables. You can obtain these values from your Stripe dashboard.
* Ensure all config variables match the ones in your settings.py file. Below are the steps to complete this process:

* Retrieve Stripe Keys
> Go to your Stripe dashboard and obtain the necessary API keys.

* Set Config Variables in Heroku

> Navigate to your Heroku app's settings tab.
> Click on "Reveal Config Vars."
> Add the following config variables with their corresponding values from your Stripe dashboard:
> STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
> STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
> Any other Stripe-related variables you have in your settings.py.
> Update settings.py
> Ensure the config variables in your settings.py file match those in Heroku. For example:

> STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = os.environ.get('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY')
> STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY')
* By following these steps, you can successfully integrate Stripe with your project and ensure all necessary configuration variables are properly set up for deployment.

#### **Cloning From Original Repository Instructions** ####

* To clone the project's repository to your local computer, follow these steps:

1. Visit the project's repository on GitHub: https://github.com/StanimirVasev/ci-project-4
