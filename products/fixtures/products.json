The camera has 693 phase detection AF points covering nearly 93% of the image area, plus 425 tight AF contrast detection points for improved focus. The Sony α7 III can shoot in one continuous burst with up to 10 fps AF / AE tracking and up to 8 fps continuous live-view shooting. In addition to speed and AF, the enhanced processing capabilities allow images to be obtained with clarity and reduced noise across the entire sensitivity range of ISO 100-51200 ( 50-204800 ). Video recording capabilities are also enhanced for better UHD 4K video recording, and thanks to the 5-axis SteadyShot INSIDE stabilization that the Sony A7 III has, you get high-performance jitter correction with up to 5 stops.",
